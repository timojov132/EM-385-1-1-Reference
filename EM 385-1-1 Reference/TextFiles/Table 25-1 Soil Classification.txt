Soil Classification
Soil Type 	Criteria 	Other Considerations 
Stable Rock	Natural solid mineral that can be excavated with vertical sides and remain intact while exposed.	
Type A 	Cohesive soil with an unconfined compressive strength of 1.5 tons per square foot (tsf) (144 kPa) or greater. 	Can not be Type A if soil is:\n1) fissured;\n2) subject to vibration from heavy traffic, pile driving, etc.;\n3) previously disturbed;\n4) part of sloped, layered system where layers dip into excavation on a slope of 4H:1V or greater; or\n5) subject to other factors requiring it to be classified as less stable material.
Type B 	Cohesive soil with an unconfined compressive strength greater than 0.5 tsf (48 kPa) but less than 1.5 tsf (144 kPa). 	Type B soil can also be:\n1) granular cohesionless soils such as angular gravel, silt, silt loam, sandy loam, and in some cases, silty clay loam and sandy clay loam;\n2) previously disturbed soils except those which would otherwise be classed as Type C soil;\n3) soil that meets the requirements of Type A, but is fissured or subject to vibration;\n4) dry rock that is not stable; or \n5) part of sloped, layered system where layers dip into excavation on a slope of 4H:1V , but only if the soil would otherwise be classed as Type A. "
Type C 	Cohesive soil with an unconfined compressive strength of 0.5 tsf (48 kPa) or less. 	Type C soil can also be:\n1) granular soils including gravel, sand, and loamy sand;\n2) submerged soil or soil from which water is freely seeping; \n3) submerged rock is not stable; or \n4) part of sloped, layered system where layers dip into excavation on a slope of 4H:1V or steeper."\nCan NOT be benched!
