Energy Ratio and Peak Particle Velocity Formula
The maximum total energy ration (ER) shall be limited to 1.0, calculated as follows:\n.    ER = (3.29FA)^2\nwhere:\nF = frequency in cycles per second\nA = amplitude in inches\n\nThe total energy ratio is equal to the arithmetic sum of the energy ratios in the 3 mutually perpendicular  planes of motion in the vertical horizontal directions at any one instant of time.
The maximum total peak particle velocity (PV) shall be limited to 1.92, calculated as follows:\n       PV = A/t\nwhere:\n A = amplitude in inches\nt = time in seconds\n\nThe total peak particle velocity is equal to the vector sum of the particle velocities in the 3 mutually perpendicular  planes of motion in the vertical and horizontal directions at any one instant of time.
