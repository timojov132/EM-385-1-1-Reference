Notes: 	
"(1) If rubber insulating gloves with leather protectors are required by NFPA 70E. Table 130.7(C)(9), additional leather or arc-rated gloves are not required. The combination of rubber insulating gloves with leather protectors satisfies the arc flash protection requirement. "	
"(2) Face shields are to have wrap-around guarding to protect not only the face but also the forehead, ears, and neck, or, alternatively, an arc-rated arc flash suit hood is required to be worn. "	
"(3) Arc rating is defined in Article 100 and can be either the arc thermal performance value (ATPV) or energy of break open threshold (EBT). ATPV is defined in ASTM F 1959, Standard Test Method for Determining the Arc Thermal Performance Value of Materials for Clothing, as the incident energy on a material, or a multilayer system of materials, that results in a 50 percent probability that sufficient heat transfer through the tested specimen is predicted to cause the onset of a second-degree skin burn injury based on the Stoll curve, in cal/cm2. EBT is defined in ASTM F 1959 as the incident energy on a material or material system that results in a 50 percent probability of breakopen. Arc rating is reported as either ATPV or EBT, whichever is the lower value."
